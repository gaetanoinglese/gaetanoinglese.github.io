    I am a PhD Candidate at the

    My research examines the political implications of economic insecurity in Western Europe, with a specific focus on young and highly educated individuals.<br>
	My dissertation investigates three central challenges faced by young and highly educated individuals in today’s knowledge economies: declining income returns 
	to education, the impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI), and housing unaffordability. <br>
	I argue that these pressures fuel discontent with the market economy and detachment from mainstream politics, especially during the formative years of political socialisation, 
	creating lasting effects on political behaviour. Building on cross-disciplinary insights from political sociology, labour economics, and political behaviour, 
	my research identifies the expectation-reality gap as a core mechanism behind political responses to economic insecurity. <br>
	Employing panel surveys and administrative data, I implement both observational and design-based methodologies with a strong focus on causal inference.

    <div style="text-align: justify;">
    The expansion of higher education in knowledge economies has fostered the belief that investment in education brings economic rewards and enhances security. 
		However, the fast-growing advancements in Artificial Intelligence are transforming highly skilled sectors, fueling perceptions of risk and uncertainty among highly educated workers. 
		What are the political implications of this new trend? This paper examines whether AI-driven threats to graduates' employability erode their faith in the meritocratic system, leading to shifts in economic preferences and voting intentions as a consequence. 
		The paper builds on a dataset linking individual-level surveys and administrative data on online job vacancies in the United Kingdom with novel indices of occupational exposure to AI. 
		Leveraging the introduction of ChatGPT in December 2022, the paper demonstrates how AI causally affects the employability of graduates across different fields of higher education. 
		Negative shifts alter individuals' fairness beliefs, shift ideological self-placement to the left and drive anti-incumbent voting intentions. 
		The study importantly underscores how AI is likely to influence the political views and behaviours of the young and highly educated, suggesting important and long-lasting political repercussions for knowledge economies.  </div>

  <strong> Aspirational, Still? Local House Price Increase and Political Preferences </strong><br>
  <details>
    <summary> Abstract </summary>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
    Housing is a growing policy concern in advanced democracies. 
		As prices surge, concerns about homeownership intensify, particularly among younger generations who increasingly feel priced out of the housing market. 
		While existing research indicates that rising house prices lead to increased conservatism among homeowners, the effects on renters remain poorly understood. 
		This paper argues that political responses to housing booms depend on perceptions of affordability, which vary across individuals' life stages. 
		Focusing on the United Kingdom, I employ a shift-share instrument leveraging variation in local housing stock composition and regional price trends across property types to identify the causal effect of house price shocks. 
		Using panel data and instrumental variable estimates, I find that exogenous increases in house prices strengthen anti-redistributive attitudes among homeowners. 
		Among renters, rising prices increase support for Reform UK. 
		These findings highlight a deepening political cleavage between asset-owning homeowners and disenfranchised renters, offering new insights into the political consequences of housing inequality in advanced capitalist democracies.

  <strong>  Unmet Expectations and Attitudes towards the Role of Government  </strong><br>
  <details>
    <summary> Abstract </summary>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
    Young people in advanced democracies are living through a period of enduring economic insecurity. 
		While growing up with the meritocratic belief that the labour market rewards effort in education, young people often experience a mismatch between their expectations and the reality of work life. 
		This paper studies the political consequences of unmet income expectations among young people in advanced capitalist democracies. It argues that the gap between expectations formed during early adulthood and real outcomes across the life-cycle shifts beliefs about the fairness of the market system, increasing demands for government intervention in the economy. If such a gap is experienced during formative years, it leaves a lasting imprint across the life cycle. 
		Using 30 waves of the British Household Panel - Understanding Society panel dataset, the paper finds that early life unmet expectations about income are a stronger predictor of attitudes towards economic interventionism than real earnings. 
		Moreover, it is stronger among those with higher education and from more privileged social class backgrounds. 
		The paper contributes to the literature on redistribution preferences by shedding new light on the subjective mechanisms underlying economic attitudes and unveiling the potential political implications of economic disappointment at a young age.

  <strong> <h3> Economic Shocks and the Masculinity Threat </h3> </strong><br>
  <details>
    <summary> Summary </summary>
      <div style="text-align: justify;">
    This project explores whether young men interpret future economic insecurity as a threat to their masculinity and therefore turn to radical right parties, whereas women may be less likely to frame insecurity in cultural and identity-based terms. 
	Using survey experiments and observational causal inference approaches, this research will extend the broader agenda on the politics of economic insecurity of young people in Western Europe.

  <strong>Seeds: Economic Development and the Persistence of Authoritarianism</strong><br>

    <summary>Abstract</summary>
        <div style="text-align: justify;">
    This study investigates whether citizens of autocratic governments become more or less authoritarian when benefiting from successful development policies.
    Divergent theories provide divergent predictions: modernization theory suggests that economic well-being fosters demands for democratization, while retrospective gratitude may bolster autocratic legitimacy.
    Additionally, autocrats often can facilitate positive responsibility attribution by relying on propaganda.
    To explore the question, this study leverages the Battle for Wheat, fascist Italy’s cornerstone agricultural policy, which rapidly and substantially increased wheat yields throughout the country in the late 1920s.
    Employing an instrumental variable approach based on soil productivity changes from low to intermediate inputs, findings reveal that higher wheat yields led to increased support for the neo-fascist party MSI post-WWII, persisting for three to five decades despite democratization efforts.
    Heterogeneity based on radio signal strength, interpreted as a quasi-exogenous proxy for propaganda intensity, shows that the lingering support is concentrated in areas most heavily exposed to fascist media.
    In these same areas, more evidence of collective memory is indicated by street names and monuments glorifying the regime.
    However, an analysis of public opinion polling suggests that development outcomes are positively correlated with long-term democratic preferences and that, while neo-fascist voters generally display more authoritarian preferences, they do to a lesser extent in the locations most benefited by the policy.
    Overall, voters who likely associated themselves with neo-fascist parties due to lived or inherited policy benefits seem to harbour less anti-democratic tendencies.
    Operating distinctions based on the narratives that lead voters to autocratic parties is crucial to understanding their success and long-term persistence.

  <strong>Scoops: A Theory of Access Journalism and Media Crookedness</strong><br>

    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
      This study proposes a rationale for media bias based on
      incumbents' strategic provision of news to politically neutral media outlets.
      In the model, the politician holds newsworthy information by having direct
      access to government activities. Media outlets are interested in publishing
      news to increase their readership and reputation. 
      The incumbent strategically provides it, asking for lenient coverage of bad news, such as scandals or
      policy blunders, in exchange. As a result, forgoing some of its reputation,
      the media withholds bad news when it detects it. Thus, a perfectly Bayesian representative
      voter — who receives the news report anticipating the possibility of this cooperation — is still
      more likely to re-elect the incumbent. This access journalism dynamic creates supply-side media bias without
      ideological preferences or media capture, but simply due to market incentives.
      Moreover, the model highlights how concerns around reputation lead the media
      to be more lenient towards high-prior incumbents. This dynamic inflates the
      difference in the likelihood of observing scandals by bad incumbents relative
      to good incumbents beyond their differences in expected congruence,
      substantiating their claims of media crookedness.

    My doctoral dissertation features two other empirical studies from the Italian experience in the last century: 
    one on the interplay between fascist radio propaganda and repression levels, the other on industrial policy through State shareholding in the post-war period. 
    More quantitative historical work on agricultural policy, climate migration, and public housing is on the horizon.<br>
    I also explored formal theory: with <a href="https://www.kunheo.com/" target="_blank">Kun Heo</a>, 
    I developed a model that shows how access journalism can legitimise media "crookedness" claims.
