  <p>
    I am a doctoral researcher in political science and political economy at the
    <a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/government">Government Department</a> of the
    <a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/">London School of Economics and Political Science</a>.

  <p> 
    My job market paper, joint with <a href="https://paugrau.cat/">Pau Grau-Vilalta</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/andreaxamo/home">Andrea Xamo</a>, investigates the behaviour of loyalist and career-appointed bureaucrats in Fascist Italy. 
    My PhD dissertation features two other empirical studies drawn from the Italian context: one on the inteplay between fascist radio propaganda and repression levels, one on industrial policy through State shareholding in the post-War period. More quantitative historical work is underway.<br>
    I am also interested in formal theory and, with <a href="https://www.kunheo.com/">Kun Heo</a>, I developed a model that shows how access journalism can legitimize media "crookedness" claims.

    During my PhD, I have been a Graduate Teaching Assistant for three courses in political economy,
    helped organise the last two editions of the Behavioural Political Economy Workshop,

  <strong>Feather-Handed Fascists:
Surveillance as a Signal of Bureaucratic Loyalty</strong><br>
  With <a href="https://paugrau.cat/">Pau Grau-Vilalta</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/andreaxamo/home">Andrea Xamo</a><br>
  <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    How do bureaucrats' incentives shape surveillance in autocratic regimes? 
    Most explanations relate bureaucratic output to ideological alignment or expertise. 
    This paper shows that it can be mainly driven by bureaucrats who need to signal their loyalty to the regime. 
    We compile a province–year dataset for Fascist Italy (1922–40) that links originally digitised biographies and appointments of all 415 provincial prefects to the universe of about 100,000 state surveillance dossiers, and we focus on the ones that voluntarily joined the Fascist Party, particularly before it seized power. 
    We then estimate a Difference-in-Differences design exploiting prefect mobility.
    Prefects with this credible loyalty marker opened about 20 per cent fewer dossiers than career-appointed counterparts. 
    After testing multiple alternative explanations, including competence and preferential deployment, we highlight that credible loyalists achieved comparable job security with lower surveillance and focused less on "usual suspects", relative to career-appointed colleagues. 
    The pattern fits loyalty-signalling motives: careerists, starting from lower loyalty priors, have to work harder to secure their positions. 
    These findings provide rare systematic evidence on authoritarian surveillance and show how career concerns, rather than ideology or competence alone, can be powerful drivers of coercive behaviour.

  <strong>Picking Winners: Evidence on State-steered Structural Transformation</strong><br>
  <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    This paper studies the role of state equity participation in shaping industrial development in postwar Italy (1945-1973). 
    Using a panel of more than 30 thousand joint-stock firms, linked to ownership information from the main state holding companies (IRI, ENI, and EFIM), I examine the firm- and sector-level consequences of state acquisitions on balance sheet indicators. Complementary Difference-in-differences and Two-way Fixed Effects models show that state participation increases firm size, equity, and assets, but has heterogeneous effects on profitability, depending on pre-acquisition performance. Importantly, sector-level estimates show positive spillovers onto private firms, consistent with state investment acting as a coordination device for industrial expansion. 
    The findings indicate that state-steered industrialization in Italy expanded volumes, though often at the cost of reduced profitability, and focalised private capital.

  <strong>The Bolshevik roots of social capital: an empirical investigation [Master's thesis]</strong><br>
  <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    This paper investigates the long-term effects of the Red Scare on social capital in Italy. Revolutionary threats required important political mobilization, introducing social struggle to previously inactive areas in the country. 
    Drawing on war casualties as a source of exogenous variation, I show that the Red Scare (1919-20) led to a sizeable decrease in social capital within the length of a generation, with limited evidence of long-term effects. The impact varies and is positive for communities historically mobilizing for the first time during the period, as documented by historical accounts. 
    I suggest evidence in favour of the role of polarization and the subsequent political violence.
